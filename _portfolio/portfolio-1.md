This portfolio entry delves into my RAID Implementation project, where I designed and developed drivers for RAID0 and RAID4 systems. The project aimed to enhance data storage solutions through fault tolerance and improved performance.

## Key Achievements

- **RAID0 Implementation:** Successfully implemented RAID0, also known as striping, to improve the speed of data reading and writing.
- **RAID4 Implementation:** Developed RAID4, which adds fault tolerance by using a dedicated parity disk, ensuring data integrity.
- **Performance Analysis:** Conducted thorough performance analysis to compare the efficiency of different RAID configurations.

## Technologies Used

- BUSE (Block device in UserSpacE) for creating virtual RAID devices
- Python and C for driver development
- Performance testing tools for analysis

This project highlighted the practical applications of RAID technology in improving data storage reliability and efficiency, making it suitable for businesses needing robust data management solutions.
