This project is a scaled-down version of the popular social media app TikTok, designed to demonstrate the core functionalities of video sharing, user interactions, and content management. The Mini-TikTok platform allows users to upload, view, and interact with videos in a streamlined interface.

## Features

- **Video Upload and Playback:** Users can upload videos directly from their devices and play them within the app.
- **User Authentication:** Secure login and registration system to manage user profiles and sessions.
- **Real-time Interaction:** Features like likes, comments, and shares to engage with content creators and other users.
- **Algorithmic Feed:** A simple recommendation algorithm that personalizes the video feed based on user preferences and interaction history.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React for dynamic user interfaces, integrated with Redux for state management.
- **Backend:** Node.js and Express for server-side logic, handling API requests, and user authentication.
- **Database:** MongoDB for storing user data, video metadata, and interaction records.
- **Video Storage:** AWS S3 for reliable and scalable video storage.

## Development Challenges

- **Video Streaming Efficiency:** Optimizing video streaming to ensure smooth playback even on lower bandwidths.
- **Security Measures:** Implementing robust security protocols to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.
- **Scalability:** Designing the backend to handle increasing loads as user numbers grow.

This project provided practical experience in building and managing a full-stack application, showcasing how modern web technologies can be integrated to create highly interactive and user-centric platforms.
